Let's create an application to manage people phone numbers and addresses.

The exercise can be worth 1-5 points. To receive one point, you should implement the following functionality:

    1 adding a phone number to the relative person
    2 phone number search by person

to receive two points we also require

    3 name search by phone number

to receive three points also

    4 adding an address to the relative person
    5 personal information search (search for a person's address and phone number)

if you want to receive four points, also implement

    6 removing a person's information

and to receive all the points:

    7 filtered search by keyword (retrieving a list which must be sorted by name in alphabetic order), the keyword can appear in the name or address
